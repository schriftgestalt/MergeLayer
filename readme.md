# Merge Layer
This plugins helps to combine to masters on export. E.g.: when you have a solid and a highlight layer and you like to have a font that combines both. 
The highlight layer with the solid layer in the background:

![Outlines](SampleFile/outlines.png)

The Merged instance uses the coordinates from the solid masters and has a Custom Parameter "MergeLayer" with the value of the name of the "highlight" master:

### Requirements

The plugin needs Glyphs 2.6 or higher. I assume it will not work in earlier versions.
